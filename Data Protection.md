# Sharing of survey data

One of the big questions of the initiators of the ISAR archive is:

---
>Is it allowed to share the pseudonymous of our noise annoyance data?

The short answer is **no**.

The longer answer is however: Yes, if it is anonymous. According to the GDPR, personal data protection principles do not apply to anonymous data. This means that the GDPR does not apply to data that has been stripped of any identifying information and cannot be used to identify an individual.

If there is no legal basis (such as the informed consent) for the researcher to share personal data of study participants, anonymisation is one potential option to share the data.

Even if there is a legal basis for sharing personal data, it is important to minimize the data as much as possible. Data minimization is a principle in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The goal of data minimization is to protect the privacy of individuals by limiting the amount of personal data collected and processed.
