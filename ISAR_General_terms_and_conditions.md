# **ISAR General terms and conditions**

**Version x from x, 2023**

**agreed on by the ICBEN officers and team chairs of Team 6 as of xx.xx.xxxx**

## Preface

This document regulates the general terms and conditions of the ICBEN Socio-Acoustic Survey Data Archive ISAR. It is binding for all persons who curate the archive (ICBEN representatives), work with the data in the archive (data users), or provide their own data for the archive (data providers). These general terms and conditions may be updated from time to time.

## About ISAR

The International Committee on Biological Effects of Noise (ICBEN) maintains an open archive of original exposure and response data from so called socio-acoustic noise studies, called ISAR (ICBEN Socio-Acoustic Survey Data Archive). The ISAR archive caters to noise effects researchers around the globe and enables pooled analyses, establishment of generalized exposure-response relationships, trend analyses both spatially and temporally, as well as cross-cultural comparisons of noise reactions (e.g. noise annoyance). Data in the ISAR archive are fully anonymous. The archive is openly accessible to everyone and tries to adopt a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data culture as far as possible and is published on the ZENODO platform under a Creative Commons license (see below for details). The first version of the archive was released in June 2023, on the occasion of ICBEN's 14th congress and its 50th anniversary (Version 2023.001). The most up to date documentation of the archive can be looked up at www.icben.org/isar, whereas the archive itself can be accessed at [https://zenodo.org/record/123456789](https://zenodo.org/record/123456789).

## Role of ICBEN as data curator

ICBEN is an organization of noise effects researchers and as such is interested in serving its community with an up to date high-quality archive of individual response data from (former) socio-acoustic noise studies. ICBEN constantly seeks to extend the archive with new study data and thus, every new contribution to the archive is highly welcome. ICBEN commits to use the data delivered by data providers only for the purpose of extending the archive. Data providers retain all their rights on their data and ICBEN does not acquire ownership of data or copyright. As curating body, ICBEN 

1. requests from peers in the noise effects research community to make their data available for the archive, 
1. enforces minimal formatting and documentation requirements of data that are delivered to the archive, 
1. organizes the data, 
1. documents the archive, and 
1. makes the archive publicly available in a convenient form (i.e. as an easily accessible online repository).

The goal of this process is that the value of the archive is maintained in each new version over time, and that the data in the archive remain available for reuse within the scientific community. The archive is curated (managed) by ICBEN representatives (officers and team chairs of Team 6), but any other ICBEN-affiliated person can also act as data curator of the ISAR archive.

Once the data curation activities for a new version of the archive are finished, the archive is published on the ZENODO[^1]
 platform and receives an unequivocal citable digital object identifier (DOI).

## Licensing

The ISAR archive is published under a CC Attribution Share-Alike License[^2], which has this easily recognizable logo:

![CC BY SA Logo](https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/88x31/png/by-sa.png)

This license requires the data user (the licensee) to cite or credit the data source (i.e. the ICBEN/ISAR archive and/or the people that work for it) in all works that are based on data in the archive, in the manner specified by ICBEN and laid down in the applicable Terms and Conditions, i.e. this document (see Section 5). Furthermore, data users may distribute derivative works (e.g. overview tables derived from data in the archive) only under a license identical to ("not more restrictive than") the CC BY SA license that governs ISAR. ISAR data can also be used commercially, as long as the commercial activity pursuits a basically scientific goal. This means, for example, that a private environmental consulting firm can use the data in the archive to produce a review on noise effects commissioned and paid by, e.g., a government agency.

## Terms and conditions for data providers

The ISAR archive is an open research data repository, and the data providers are responsible to ensure that the content they make available for the archive is suitable for open dissemination and that it complies with applicable laws, including, but not limited to, privacy, data protection, and intellectual property rights. Such data have been collected by the data provider or its institution in accordance with the local data protection regulations and have been anonymized to an appropriate degree (see below). Data providers are expressly advised to only contribute study data for the archive that can be passed on to a third party (i.e. the scientific community) without violating any rights of another third party.

It is of utmost importance that the data supplied by the data providers are completely anonymous. This means that the data do not contain any personally identifiable information and that the combination of variables does not allow re-identification of a person. A person is considered unidentifiable or no longer identifiable if a significant effort would be required to identify him or her.

Unknown to ICBEN is the original nature of the consent regarding allowed uses of the originally collected data, and if study participants consented to such use. It is therefore within the responsibility of the data provider to only supply data for which explicit or implicit consent has been given for such uses like inclusion in the ISAR archive.

Whenever a data provider releases their study data into the archive, a contract is set up that must be signed by an ICBEN representative as well as by the data provider. In certain exceptional cases, a data provider may relinquishes their data into the archive without a mutually signed contract, but with agreement documented in another form (e.g. confirmation by e-mail). Data providers must explicitly agree that their delivered data will, as part of the archive, be published online and that the data will be made available under a CC BY SA license.

## Terms and conditions for data users

Data users are persons or institutions that access the data in the archive for scientific purposes, e.g. for carrying out pooled analyses across all or a selection of data in the archive in the context of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and similar undertakings. Data users may also use data from one single study alone, a possibility data providers should be aware of. As the ISAR archive adopts an open data philosophy and is openly available to everyone, there are no specific restrictions ICBEN can impose on data users. This means that anyone can download the archive and analyze its data without consent from ICBEN. For that reason, no formal (mutually signed) contract is established between ICBEN and data users. However, ICBEN would highly appreciate if data users could adhere to the following principles:

- not to sell the data in the archive to a third party
- not to copy the entirety of the archive and make it publicly available
- not to use or disclose the data (or components) for any purpose other than scientific or as required by law
- not to try to contact or attempt to identify any individuals from or about whom the data in the archive apply
- to indemnify, defend and hold harmless ICBEN as well as any of its representatives from and against any claim, cause of action, liability, damage, cost or expense arising out of or in connection with any unauthorized or prohibited use or disclosure of the ISAR data
- to acknowledge ICBEN and the ISAR archive in published works, where appropriate
- to duly inform ICBEN or any of its representatives about any new publications that are based on the ISAR data

By downloading all or parts of the ISAR archive from the online repository, these general terms and conditions take effect, which means that data users implicitly agree to abide by the terms and conditions in this document.

## Referencing the archive in published works and version numbering system

The ISAR archive is physically stored on the ZENODO platform and has a unique and persistent DOI, which is 11.5281/zenodo.3723336336. This is the _external_ identification of the archive per se, i.e. of all versions of the archive. Because the archive grows with the inclusion of new study data, or shrinks with the removal of (withdrawn) study data, each ISAR archive version also carries an internal version number which includes the year with the most recent entry (or removal) and a number which is incremented by 1 whenever a new entry was made into the archive or when a study (its data) was removed from it. The initial version of the archive has the internal number 2023.001, indicating the first version of the archive, released in the year 2023. Every new archive version will be tagged and pushed to ZENODO, in order to also generate a long-time stable (individual) version-DOI. In published works, data users should always refer to the exact version-DOI (i.e. the DOI of the version of the archive whose data they have worked with).

Data users are requested to reference the archive in any publication that is based on data in the archive as follows: _International Commission on Biological Effects of Noise, ICBEN Socio-Acoustic Survey Data Archive Version \<insert pertinent archive version number\> [Data set]. Zenodo. \<insert URL for the exact version-DOI\>_
